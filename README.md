## About The Project

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With PHP

<p>
The client, ‘Smart Counties R Us’, is a social entrepreneur with an initiative to promote the 'smart city' agenda in suburban and rural areas. The client’s aim is to provide a ‘more direct form of local democracy’  by combining a facility for local councils to track possible utilisation of ‘smart technology’ with a platform where small to medium enterprises (SME) can promote relevant ‘smart’ products in a local area. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><h5>SMEs and Products</h5>

The prototype needs to allow SMEs to register details, such as company name, contact phone number, etc., and the ‘smart’ product(s) they supply. Details of each product include not only the name of the product but a short description of what the product is for, size and material of the product where applicable, the product’s type/environment (such as exterior fixture, household appliance, etc.) and price band: low-range, mid-range, or high-range. The client has confirmed that at present each product can be registered only once, with one SME.
</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p><h>Residents</h5>
  The prototype is designed for residents to browse ‘smart’ products and register their interest in those they feel would be beneficial to where they live. Each         resident can vote on as many products they are interested in, but residents need to register on the application in order to vote on a product(s). Details required     from them include the area they live in, gender and age bracket.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><h5>Votes</h5>

To vote for a product, residents are required to indicate whether the product’s price band is something they would be prepared to pay for, envisaged as a “Yes/No” field. 
Residing Areas 
The idea is that the SMEs will monitor residents’ votes to establish potential demand, supply and marketing for their product(s). An aim of the platform is to promote smart products beyond an urban environment. Therefore, it is crucial to record the area where a resident lives. The client has described that a dropdown menu of areas needs to be visible when a resident registers.
<p>
<br>
It has been decided that local councils are responsible for signing up (adding) their residing area on the application so that their residents can utilise the application’s facilities. Local councils will also be able to use the platform to monitor which smart products residents in their area are interested in, and they may also use this information to work with SMEs in promoting particular ‘smart’ initiatives to local residents.
</p>
